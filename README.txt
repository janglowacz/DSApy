This is DSApy version A0.5

Features are:
- Die rolling
- Talent rolling
- Spell & Liturgy rolling
- Rudimentaray combat rolling

Start the program using "CORE.py".

Getting your character imported requires exporting the Selbstrechner as a json string, and then putting it in a .json file.

There are probably some bugs.
The only requirement is to have python3 installed.
If you want to use spells or liturgies that are not included yet, please send me your character sheet so I can add them.

Enjoy!
