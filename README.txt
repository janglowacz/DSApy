This is DSApy version A0.5

Features are:
- Die rolling
- Talent rolling
- Spell & Liturgy rolling
- Rudimentaray combat rolling

Start the program using "CORE.py".

Getting your character imported requires exporting the Selbstrechner as a json string, and then putting it in a .json file.

There are probably some bugs.
If I coded everything correctly the only required thing is to have python3 installed, I have not tested this yet.
If you want to use spells or liturgies that are not included yet, please send me your character sheet so I can add them.

Enjoy!
