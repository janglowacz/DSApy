This is DSApy Version A0.4

Features are:
- Die rolling
- Talent rolling
- Spell & Liturgy rolling

Start the program using "CORE.py".

Getting your character imported requires exporting the Selbstrechner as a json string, and then putting it in a .json file.

There are probably some bugs.
If I coded everything correctly the only required thing is to have python3 installed, I have not tested this yet.

Enjoy!
